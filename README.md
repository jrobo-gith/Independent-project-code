# Independant Project Code
This repo contains code for the modelling of stability of thin films using Newtonian and non-Newtonian rheologies for the investigation into the conditions for which the film becomes unstable due to build up of disjoint pressure. These models will be applied to the slurry of a battery, where instabilities in the film cause the undesirable effect of inefficiency.

## Steps to completion 
These are the rough steps to complete the project; to aquire the data needed to draw novel and interesting conclusions from their outputs.
