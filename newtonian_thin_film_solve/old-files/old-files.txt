startup-flow-central-differences_1:- Removed to make way for Runge-Kutta method which is a better, pre-built solver so
it's more reliable.

startup-flow-central-differences_2:- Removed because it was a bad attempt at solving it and was going in the wrong
direction. Thomasina and i discussed it and we didnt have enough BCs to do it that way, so we had to do it a more
difficult way.

startup-flow-Runge-Kutta:- Removed because it was close but didnt use Runge-Kutta and required a clean restart.

startup-flow-fwd-bwd:- Attempt at Ferran's advice of using forward and backward differences to solve the eq, turns
out he was talking about using the finite volume method in conjunction with finite differences, I need to start again.

startup-flow-finite-vol_V1,2,3:- all didn't work because we weren't using the correct finite differences on the third
order term, after ferran switched some stuff around it worked on the new file.

meeting:- refers to the code wrote in the meeting dated 07/07/25, doesn't work but keeping just for reference.
